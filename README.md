# Fruit-Snake-Game

This is a Java program that implements a Snake game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game has the following features:

    The player controls a snake that moves around the screen trying to collect apples.
    The snake grows in size as it collects more apples.
    The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    The player can use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

To start the game, the user can call the startGame method. The game will then start and the player can use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game will end if the snake collides with the walls or itself, and a game over message will be displayed.
